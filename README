RSS2map is a script that uses Placemaker and Yahoo Maps to display any RSS feed on a map. You don't need to know how to use maps or Placemaker, simply provide the feed URL and include rss2map.php where you want the map to appear. 

For example:

<?php 
  $rss2mapfeed = 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/rss';
  include('rss2map.php');
?>
